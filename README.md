MATLAB Skript of the Pan-Tompkins QRS Detector
(Pan et al. 1985: A Real-Time QRS Detection Algorithm. IEEE Trans Bio Eng. Vol. 32, No. 3, S.230-236)

This is an offline implementation of the QRS-detection, which nevertheless is realizing a adaptive detection (from beat to beat) like the proposed online implementation. Compared to the original proposed filtering, all filtering is replaced by phase zero filtering. The most important intermediate data (different feature signals) is available as an optional output.
